        <h3><i class="fas fa-viruses"></i>  Stopping the spread starts with knowing how it spreads</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The virus spreads from person to person</li>
            <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
            <li>Droplets from an infected person is the main cause of the spread.</li>
            <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
            <li>Studies have shown that some people can be asymptomatic and not show any signs of the virus, but can still have it and spread it. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-hand-sparkles"></i>  Washing your hands often will helps stop the spread</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Be sure to wash your hands for at least 20 seconds after touching in public, sneezing, and coughing.</li>
            <li>If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.</li>
            <li>Be sure to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><i class="fas fa-head-side-mask"></i>  Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others</h3>

            <li>Make sure to throw away used tissues away in the trash.</li>
            <li>Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If you aren't able to do that then make sure you have hand sanitizer to sanitze your hands.</li>
